# positions-dnd

"HOW TO START ?"
1. Run "npm run dev"
2. Run "npm i" to install node_modules
3. Open "localhost3000"

Hi, I am Daniel and this is my test task

1. I think, I have done the majority if not all of the requirements for this task (mandatory + additional)
    Functionalities:
    - When you press "Create new position" an empty card appears and the focus changes to the right modal, where you can fill all the data, except the salary (It wasn't in the design, so it's 0 by default)
    - I used react-beautiful-dnd to implement drag and drop, and everything works, you can even drag a card to a dedicated space and drop it in the bin to delete it
    - You can edit the position the very moment you click on it, the data appears in the right form and it immediately brings changes to the position, you don't even need to press "Save"
    - All tabs are switchable, the inside of other tabs is empty
    - The tab panel was created according to the design
    - On the right you have an input where you can write the name of the position + if you don't press the "Create new position" button and start filling in the form a new card will be automatically created  
    - Form has checkboxes with animation, that were created according to the design

    Additional Functionalities:
    - The positions are saved after the reload because I have used localStorage to store them.
    - There is one console.log and it is data from the form, as I understood, that was what you wanted
    - There are some animations on buttons, positions, checkboxes, etc.

2. As there wasn't direct communication with the designer I might have done some sort of thing a little different, but I hope you will go into my position.

3. All in all I really enjoyed doing it, at one moment I started putting too much time into details, but I hope it wasn't in vain.

 Bonbon
